# N-Body-Display
This project is a C++ implementation of a graphical n-body gravitational simulation which uses the Barnes-Hut approximation method. It uses the SFML graphics library and is based on a [Performance Engineering Project](https://github.com/PhivPap/Performance-Engineering/tree/master/Project).


## Usage 
### Requirements:
- Visual Studio 17 or newer
- python3 (only for new input dataset generation)


### Installation
```
git clone "https://github.com/PhivPap/N-Body-Display"
```

### Input
All input files (files containg body positions, velocities and mass) can be found in *Bodyfiles/in*. 

In the *Bodyfiles/* directory, there are two python scripts which generate input files. They do not accept command line arguments, their configuration is set inline.
